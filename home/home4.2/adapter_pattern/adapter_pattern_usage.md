### Example Scenario: Integrating a New Payment Gateway into an E-commerce System

#### Context:
An e-commerce platform has been using a legacy payment processing system for years. The system interacts with various payment services through a set of well-defined but outdated interfaces. The company decides to integrate a modern payment gateway to offer customers more payment options and improve transaction security.

#### Problem:
The new payment gateway has a different interface and set of methods for processing payments, checking transaction status, and handling refunds compared to the legacy system. Directly modifying the legacy codebase to accommodate the new gateway would be risky, time-consuming, and costly. It could also introduce bugs and require extensive testing.

#### Solution with Adapter Pattern:
1. **Adapter Creation**: Implement an adapter that wraps the new payment gatewayâ€™s interface and exposes the methods expected by the legacy system. The adapter will translate calls from the legacy interface to the appropriate methods of the new payment gateway.

2. **Interface Compatibility**: The adapter ensures that the legacy system can continue to use its existing interface for payment processing without any modifications. The adapter handles all necessary conversions and method calls behind the scenes.

3. **Incremental Integration**: The Adapter pattern allows the new payment gateway to be integrated incrementally. The legacy system can continue to function normally while the new gateway is tested and verified through the adapter. This reduces the risk of disruptions to the e-commerce platform.

4. **Maintenance and Scalability**: The Adapter pattern simplifies maintenance by isolating changes required for the new payment gateway within the adapter. If another new payment gateway needs to be integrated in the future, a new adapter can be created without impacting the legacy system.
